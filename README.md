iOS Animate Transition Using SwiftUI Animations

Here, we are going to create a Present-and-Dismiss Transition where we will have a Button that will open the Settings Screen and the Settings Screen will transition as it will present itself on an angle. It will rotate downward and fade in and then become the full Settings Screen. And when we press the button on the Settings Screen, then it will dismiss it in the same way. It is a neat effect to present and dismiss a View.
